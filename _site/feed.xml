This year, we’ll be traveling to Fiji, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Netherlands, Germany, France, and Italy.

Stay tuned!</p>]]></content><author><name>William Mattingly</name></author><category term="trip planning" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year, I'll be traveling across Oceania, Australia, Asia, and Europe.

This year, we’ll be traveling to Fiji, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Netherlands, Germany, France, and Italy. This is the first time I’ve had to pack for 4 seasons across both hemispheres. And this time, I’m only bringing my backpack…Part of our goal this year was to explore new parts of the world we’d never seen. Another goal was to see all seven continents. By June, we will have been to four continents, with plans to visit South America in the July/August and Antartica in December.As usual, I’ll be bringing you some travel tips and video content from historical sites. Stay tuned!"
